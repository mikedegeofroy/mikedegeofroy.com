# Introduction

3 years ago, I wrote a post on reddit on how to uninstall Qustodio from MacOS. It was largely ignored and ended up archived, but over the years I started getting messages from people tanking me. I was surprised that somebody found my crude methods for getting rid of my parents restrictions useful, so I decided to make this information easier to find. Here's how a 13 year old cracked Qustodio.

## Disabling Qustodio

In Script Editor (Installed by default on all Macs) and run this script.

```
repeat
	set app_name to "/Library/Application Support/Qustodio/bin/qproxy/qengine /Library/Application Support/Qustodio/bin/qproxy /Library/"
	set pid to (do shell script "ps ax | grep " & (quoted form of app_name) & " | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'")
	if pid is not "" then do shell script "sudo kill -9 " & pid with administrator privileges
	set app_name to "/Library/Application Support/Qustodio/bin/qapp/QUpdateService"
	set pid to (do shell script "ps ax | grep " & (quoted form of app_name) & " | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'")
	if pid is not "" then do shell script "sudo kill -9 " & pid with administrator privileges
end repeat
```

This script finds the processes "/Library/Application Support/Qustodio/bin/qproxy/qengine /Library/Application Support/Qustodio/bin/qproxy /Library/" and "/Library/Application Support/Qustodio/bin/qapp/QUpdateService" and kills them. In my case It would ask for permissions every 30 minutes, so I saved the script as a APP and once on the desktop I right clicked it and went to "Show Package Contents", dragged the 'applet' under 'Contents/MacOS/applet' into the terminal.

In my case:
'sudo /Desktop/removequstodio.app/Contents/MacOS/applet'

_I'm not sure if this step is important but here it is anyway:_

_I opened '/Library/LaunchAgents/' and in the 'Qustodio plist' I changed all '<true/>' to '<false/>'_

_then I rebooted the computer._

## Uninstalling Qustodio

Remove all Qustodio related files under:

'/Library/LaunchAgents/'

'/Library/Preferences/'

'/Library/Application Support/'

'/Library/Caches/'

Reboot your Mac and you're done!

You can check if Qustodio is still running with 'ps -ax'
